Ingredients:
- 4 avocados
- 2 roma-style tomatoes, diced
- 1 jalapeno, finely diced
- 1/2 cup diced yellow onion
- 1 lime
- fresh cilantro (roughly 1/4 cup chopped, or to taste)
- salt (to taste)

Instructions:
1. Quarter & peel avocados into a bowl. Squeeze 1/2 of lime on top, add a dash of salt, and mash.
2. Add the diced onion, tomato, and cilantro. Stir to mix completely.
3. Taste test and add additional lime, salt, and/or cilantro if needed.

Note: if you need to store this, lay saran wrap directly on top of the guacamole and remove any air pockets; store in fridge. Alternatively, you can layer water on top of the guacamole (will need to carefully pour off before serving).
Note2: if you don't like it super spicy, make sure to remove and discard the seeds from your jalapeno before dicing and adding it.
